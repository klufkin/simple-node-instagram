Ran through Scotch.io's node instagram app tutorial.
Would recommend going through the process of getting your own api keys and tokens
instead of going through a 3rd party as this is something you will have to learn how to
navigate on the regular.

[Instagram developer site](https://www.instagram.com/developer/). This is where
you can get access to the api, go to "manage clients", set up a new client. Then in
the search bar look up "access token" and should be the first link running you through
[https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/](https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/).

In this repo you can find the pdf tutorial. If you want the whole walk through.

Note: you'll not find the instagram creds file, this is just a simple module that exports the keys
you need to access the API. Not in the repository for privacy/security purposes.
